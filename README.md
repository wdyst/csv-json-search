# csv-json-search
A small python program that checks a directory for specific text in json and csv files in a provided directory.
I personally use this to search through downloaded data collections for specific lines or events, mostly from companies like Discord.

For example, download your entire collection of user data from somewhere you have an account, wait for a copy, and then use this to search for specific lines or strings you want to view.
